1. mono ~/(your fsharp installation)/bin/fsc.exe Paint.fs Program.fs
   ( ^ the 'compile' script does this )

2. mono Program.exe

3. open out.png.

(for me on mac os x, this means my workflow is: ./compile && mono Program.exe && open out.png   
 whenever I want to attempt to compile & run the program.)
